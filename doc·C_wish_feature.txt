  Named scopes, so that the entire stack can be referenced, particularly among
  scopes within a function.

   {name1
      int x = 5;
      }

   {name2
      int x = name1.x;
      }

   Then continuation arguments could be written through the scope name.

   This would allow a scope to hold a group of continuations, i.e. a class
   instance.  

   It would make the scoped labels more useful.
