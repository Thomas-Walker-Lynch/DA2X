1. when a blank line comment occurs under other line comments, the code that follows
should be indented 

  // x is 4.
  x = 4;

  // this is a section
  //
    x = 5;


2. labels should indent like code, code following a label should indent further

    goto *__TM2x_format(tape ,byte_n ,&&format_success ,&&format_fail);
    format_fail: 
      continue_from fail;     
    format_success: 
      memcpyn(tape->base_pt ,tape_src->base_pt ,byte_n);
      continue_from success;

maybe wishe:
better blocking for line by line arguments on functions
