1. when a blank line comment occurs under other line comments, the code that follows
should be indented 

  // x is 4.
  x = 4;

  // this is a section
  //
    x = 5;


2. label indention to support the format shown in the .h and .c files in this directory.
  A little bit like switch statements. Right now labels outdent, and it is a constant fight

  continue_into TM2x_alloc_heap_format(&a0 ,0 ,byte_n_of(uint32_t) ,&&nominal_0 ,&&fail_0);
    nominal_0:
      f[i] = true;
      continue_from_local end_0;
    fail_0:
      f[i] = false;
      continue_from_local end_0;
    end_0:
      i++;
