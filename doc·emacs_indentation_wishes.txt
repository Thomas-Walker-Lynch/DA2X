1. when a blank line comment occurs under other line comments, the code that follows
should be indented 

  // x is 4.
  x = 4;

  // this is a section
  //
    x = 5;


2. found a label indentation style that works, see TM2x.h intersection. Also:

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(c-offsets-alist (quote ((label . 2))))
)
