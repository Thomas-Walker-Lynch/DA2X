A. Typically we use a non destructive programming approach when modifying the structure of a
tape:

  1. create a new destination tape of the correct length
  2. copy elements from possibly multiple source to the destination tape.

if desired, 
  3. copy the destination header to the source header
  4. deallocate the destination header

In step 2, the copy may chose any elements and put them anywhere on the destination tape.
Hence, insertions and deletions may be done.

B. If the operation can be performed on a single tape, so a destination tape and the allocation
for the destination is not needed, then the one tape may be modified.  If resize is needed,
then we make use of a temporary tape as in A.
