Suppose that a programmer makes use of functions in his or her program, but then
calls sequences from the TM library.  Or more generally we might ask, may
we adopt a hybrid programming approach that mixes functions and sequence calls?

1. encapsulated sequences

According to this technique, sequence definitions are defined within a function that
makes use of them. No sequence continuation is taken which causes control to leave the
function code that was defined in within the lexical scope of the function.

When these constraints are followed, no C90 restriction on the use of labels will
be violated.  

As all sequences must be encapsulated in the function that uses them,  we can define
sequence within functions and share the functions in a library, but we can not
share a library of sequences.  This is because continuing from a sequence found in
a library would cause control to leave the function.

See the 'pinnacle-function-encapsulated-sequences' branch of the T02x·Root for examples
of this technique.


2.  encapsulated use of sequence libraries

In the general case we would define some sequences in a library.  They would probably
have their argument pads placed in a union at the top of main.  The programmer then calls
functions from main.  Those functions then continue into sequences in the library.  Such
a thing violates the constraints for 'encapsulated sequences', so we are in new territory.  

The first problem a programmer will notice is that sequence continuations do not return.
Hence unless the continuations from those sequences continue to brings control back to
the original function, the original function will never have an opportunity to return.  So
this is what we mean by 'encapsulated use' - it is a constraint that requires the
sequences to continue back into the function they were called from.

So we must at least require 'encapsulated use'.

Suppose a library sequence is included as text in main.  This is currently the
conventional way to make use of a sequence library.  Then if that code has any stack
allocated temporary variable usage associated wnith it, and references to that data are
stack relative, then the stack pointer value will matter.  If a the caller is in
a function, the stack will be pointing to the frame for that function, not the frame that
the sequence was compiled against, so in these conditions things would go wrong.

Sequences are not intended to make use of the stack, but stack allocation of temporaries
is so embedded in the C language that a person can easily imagine cases that would be
problematic.  Take for example a line of code like this:

      register struct T02x·dealloc_Tape_heap0 *lc0 = &Sequence·Locals_pt->dealloc_Tape_heap;

This is intended to define a namespace and to replace a #define that would have copied the
text directly to variables that use the namespace.  We do not expect that lc0 actually
requires storage, but if it does then we would expect to find it in a register.  However,
the C compiler has no requirement to actually put lc0 in a register.  According to the
C specification, the compiler is free to put lc0 on the stack, as an 'auto' storage class variable.

If the compiler allocates space on the stack for such things as lc0, and a call from a
function arrives to this code with a different stack pointer, then things might indeed go
wrong.  We have already seen gcc allocate such variables in advance relative to the stack
of the main function.  If such variables were then loaded in a stack relative manner, then
a call from a function deeper down the stack to a sequence would have the wrong stack pointer
for relative addressing from the stack to find such things as lc0.

So, we can not say if a call from a function to a sequence in a library, one probably
loaded in main, from a function written by a programmer, will in fact behave
correctly. The intention is that it would, but conceivably the C compiler could connive
against us, and do so without violating the C90 spec.

3. Conclusion

A programmer may only 1) use sequences rather than functions, where the sequences
are included at the same scope level as the library, and/or 2) use functions
that encapsulate sequences  3) use functions that do not use sequences.
