1. when a blank line comment occurs under other line comments, the code that follows
should be indented 

  // x is 4.
  x = 4;

  // this is a section
  //
    x = 5;

  /* blah blah */
    x = 7   


  /* blah blah
     blah
  */
    x = 7   


2. found a label indentation style that works, see TM2x.h intersection. Also:

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(c-offsets-alist (quote ((label . 2))))
)

3. #defines for the operand continuations are not indenting ... look for a custom variable ..
 only setting I could find for pounds says: Only currently supported behavior is ‘alignleft’.
 wish they did not jump over but stayed consistent.

 e.g.

  TM2x·alloc_Tape_heap:{
    //  #include "CLib·mallocn·args.h"
    #define pt      tape
    #define n       n_of(TM2x·Tape )
    #define nominal malloc_nominal
    #define fail    mfail_alloc
    #include "CLib·mallocn.h"

  turns out we are not doing operand continuations like this, but the #includes
  are still messing everything up.
