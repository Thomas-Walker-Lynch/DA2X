  Some ideas for future features:
  Embed some flags over pointers so we can know if a dynamic deallocation is tried on a
  static allocated array and vice versa.  Add an allocation threshold after which growth
  becomes linear.  Add a allocation maximum boundary. Make the overhead pointers inclusive
  so as to avoid uncessary page wraps, or even memory wraps on microcontrollers.
